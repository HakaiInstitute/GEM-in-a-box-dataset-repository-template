The DR1900 folder contains the Nutrient data. Please take a picture of each page of the physical data sheets that have been filled out, and name them accordingly (e.g., 2024-09-16_Nutrients_raw1.jpg, 2024-09-16_Nutrients_raw2.jpg, etc). The analyzed raw data from the DR1900 can also be downloaded from the instrument in a .txt file, but it is more legible in an Excel (.xlsx) format. Both formats can be provided.
