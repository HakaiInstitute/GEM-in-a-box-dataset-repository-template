## GitHub Basics

Below are some very basic ways to interact with the GitHub UI through the web:

### Editing a file

A file, such as the readme in the root (or landing page) of the repository, can be easily modified by selecting the 'pen' icon in the top right:

_Example 2_

Please only use this to edit .md files. **Do not** use this function when editing data sheets.

### Deleting a file

To remove a file from the repository, first navigate to that file. Then select the `...` icon at the top right, scroll down and select "Delete file".

You'll be redirected to a page that shows that you have deleted the file. You'll have to commit this change by selectin `Commit changes` in the top right.
